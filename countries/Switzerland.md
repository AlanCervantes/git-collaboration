Switzerland began installing explosives in strategic locations in the 19th century.  This practice became widspread during World War II and the Cold War, in particular starting in 1975 with its Permanent Explosive Deployment 75 program.

Over the years, the Swiss army fitted roughly 2,000 structures with explosives, including bridges, tunnels, roads, and airstrips, to deter invasion and protect the nation's neutrality.
