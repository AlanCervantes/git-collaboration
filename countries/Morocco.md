## interesting trivia
	In 788, about a century after the Arab conquest of North Africa, a series of Moroccan Muslim dynasties began to rule in 
Morocco. In the 16th century, the Sa'adi monarchy, particularly under Ahmad al-MANSUR (1578-1603), repelled foreign invaders and 
inaugurated a golden age. The Alaouite Dynasty, to which the current Moroccan royal family belongs, dates from the 17th century. In 
1860, Spain occupied northern Morocco and ushered in a half century of trade rivalry among European powers that saw Morocco's 
sovereignty steadily erode; in 1912, the French imposed a protectorate over the country. A protracted independence struggle with 
France ended successfully in 1956. The internationalized city of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were turned over to the new 
country that same year. Sultan MOHAMMED V, the current monarch's grandfather, organized the new state as a constitutional monarchy and 
in 1957 assumed the title of king. Although Morocco is not the UN-recognized Administering Power for the Western Sahara, it exercises 
de facto administrative control over 80% of the territory. The UN since 1991 has monitored a ceasefire between Morocco and the 
Polisario Front and leads ongoing negotiations over the status of the territory. King MOHAMMED VI in early 2011 responded to the 
spread of pro-democracy protests in the region by implementing a reform program that included a new constitution, passed by popular 
referendum in July 2011, under which some new powers were extended to parliament and the prime minister but ultimate authority remains 
in the hands of the monarch. In November 2012, the Justice and Development Party - a moderate Islamist party - won the largest number 
of seats in parliamentary elections, becoming the first Islamist party to lead the Moroccan Government.
