## interesting trivia
Iraq is composed of 19 provinces. I personally have been to the 
following provinces Al Anbar and Babil.
It's neighboring countries include: Iran, Kuwait, Turkey, Jordan, Saudia 
Arabia, and Syria.
Both branches of Islam are heavily represented, Sunni and Shiite. In 
fact, Iraq is the location of the original schism between the two 
caliphates and the division of Islam.
