## interesting trivia
The exact origins of the Nauruans are unclear since their language does not resemble any 
other in the Pacific region. Germany annexed the island in 1888. A German-British consortium 
began mining the island's phosphate deposits early in the 20th century. Australian forces 
occupied Nauru in World War I; it subsequently became a League of Nations mandate. After the 
Second World War - and a brutal occupation by Japan - Nauru became a UN trust territory. It 
achieved independence in 1968 and joined the UN in 1999 as the world's smallest independent 
republic.
